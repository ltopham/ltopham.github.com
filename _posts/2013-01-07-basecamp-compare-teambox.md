title: Comparing Basecamp to Teambox
categories: Basecamp, Project Management, Teambox

We use Basecamp at Full Stack. I was recently introduced to Teambox and attended one of their webinars and wanted to know how they compare.

I'm no expert when it comes to Basecamp but some things I learned about Teambox make it stand out a bit. A caveat to this though - I haven't actually used Teambox day-to-day so I may change my tune once I explore it a bit more.
